\lineparagraph{Exercise}

Sequence $b_1,b_2,\dots{},b_n$ consists of nonnegative integers. We want to
determine the largest sum of monotone increasing subsequences. For example, if
the sequence is $2,1,10,6,3,8,4,9$, then the largest sum is $25$ given by
the subsequence $2,6,8,9$. Give an $O(n^2)$ algorithm that solves this problem.
(It is assumed hat arithmetic operations with arbitrary sized numbers can be
done in $1$ step.)
