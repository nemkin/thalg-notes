\subsection{Exam: 2022. 05. 30., Exercise 3}

\lineparagraph{Exercise}

Consider the following decision problem. We are given an undirected connected
graph $G$ of even number of vertices, whose edges are colored red or blue.
We want to decide whether there exists a Hamiltonian cycle in $G$ that consists
of a red path and a blue path ofthe same length, that is, going along the
Hamiltonian cycle, the red edges form a path and the blue edges form a path
and those two paths have the same number of vertices. Prove that this problem
is NP-complete.
