\subsection{Session 1, Exercise 01}

\lineparagraph{Exercise}

There are two algorithms for the same problem, $A$ and $B$. Let the functions describing their worst case running times be $f_A$ and $f_B$. It is known that $f_A(n) = O(f_B(n))$. Does it follow that...

\begin{enumerate}[a.)]
\item $A$ is faster on every input than $B$?
\item except for finitely many inputs $A$ is faster than $B$?
\item for large enough inputs $A$ is faster than $B$?
\end{enumerate}
