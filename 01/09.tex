\subsection{Session 1, Exercise 09}

\lineparagraph{Exercise}

Let both the pattern and the text consist of only $0$'s, let the length of the pattern be $m$, while that of the text be $n$. How many comparisons are done...

\begin{enumerate}[a.)]
    \item by Simple search if only the first occurrence of the pattern is sought?
    \item by Simple search if all occurrences of the pattern are needed?
    \item by Quick search if only the first occurrence of the pattern is sought?
    \item by Quick search if all occurrences of the pattern are needed?
\end{enumerate}

\lineparagraph{Solution}

\begin{enumerate}[a.)]
    \item $m$, since the first position is immediately a match.
    \item All positions match. There are $n-m+1$ positions, the pattern will be checked on all characters, so $m(n-m+1)$.
    \item $m$, since the first position is immediately a match.
    \item All positions match. There are $n-m+1$ positions, the pattern will be checked on all characters, so $m(n-m+1)$.
\end{enumerate}

Note:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In this case there is no difference between what Simple search and what Quick search does. Quick search is able to skip \textbf{some} definitely non-matching positions based on a heuristic. In this case, all positions match, there is nothing to skip.
\end{itemize}
