\subsection {Session 10, Exercise 11}

\lineparagraph {Exercise}

A directed graph $G$ of $n$ vertices and $e$ edges is given by its adjacency list. Give an $O(n+e)$ running time algorithm that determines for each vertex $v$ the number of those paths that:

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item go from a fixed source vertex to $v$,
    \item go from $v$ to a fixed end vertex.
\end{enumerate}
