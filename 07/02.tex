\subsection {Session 7, Exercise 2}

\lineparagraph {Exercise}

Let $L$ consist of triplets $(G,s,t)$ such that $G$ is a directed graph, $s$ and $t$ are two vertices of $G$ and there exists a path from $s$ to $t$. Prove hat $L \in{} P$.

\lineparagraph {Solution}

The details of the proof are similar to that of \ref{7_1}.

The main difference is that we are looking for a path between $s$ and $t$, not a cycle. To find a path, we can use a $BFS$ started from vertex $s$. If this $BFS$ finds $t$ on a path from $s$ then we accept, otherwise reject.

The less important difference is that the input can now be directed, so we don't check for adjacency matrix symmetry during the first step of the algorithm.
