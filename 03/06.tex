\subsection{Session 3, Exercise 6}

\lineparagraph{Exercise}

Give regular expressions that are shorter than the following ones but give the same languages.

\begin{enumerate}[a.)]
\item $(0+\varepsilon)^*$
\item $((0+\varepsilon)(0+\varepsilon))^*$
\item $(0+1)^*01(0+1)^*+1^*0^*$
\end{enumerate}

\lineparagraph{Solutions}

$(0+\varepsilon)^*$ can match at every recurrence either a $0$ or an empty string, repeated any number of times. We can either not match any $0$'s, then this results in the empty string, or we can match any number of $0$'s as well (with any number of empty strings in-between them, which do not add anything to the result), so this is the same as $0^*$.

For $((0+\varepsilon)(0+\varepsilon))^*$, the inner expression can match the empty string, $0$, or $00$. Repeated any number of times allows for matching any number of $0$'s, including the empty string as well. So this is also the same as $0^*$.

$(0+1)^*01(0+1)^*+1^*0^*$ is an interesting one: The word either contains a $0$, followed by a $1$ (in the first part of the sum), or... it does not: $1^*0^*$ matches words where the $1$'s can only be before the $0$'s, not after them, while $(0+1)^*01(0+1)^*+1^*0^*$ matches words where there is a $0$ that is followed by a $1$. All possible $0$/$1$ strings fit into either of these categories, so these two together match anything from $(0+1)^*$.
