\subsection{Session 3, Exercise 8}

\lineparagraph{Exercise}

What language is generated by the following grammar?

\begin{align*}
S &\rightarrow A | B\\
A &\rightarrow 0A1 | 01\\
B &\rightarrow 1B0 | 10
\end{align*}

\lineparagraph{Solution}

We make a decision at $S$, whether to continue with variable $A$, or $B$.

$A$ generates with the following producion rule: $A \rightarrow 0A1|01$, which will put the same number of $0$'s at the beginning as the number of $1$'s at the end, using the ''one to the left and one to the right'' method: every single activation of the $A \rightarrow 0A1$ puts one $0$ to the left and one $1$ to the right, making sure their numbers remain equal as we generate the string.

The empty string is not generated, because there is no production rule that would allow $A$ to terminate in a $\varepsilon$. This is the same as $0^n1^n$, where $n>0$: $L_A=\{0^n1^n|n>0\}$.

With similar logic, $L_B=\{1^n0^n|n>0\}$.

And finally, then $L = L_A \cup L_B$.
