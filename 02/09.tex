\subsection{Session 2, Exercise 9}

\lineparagraph{Exercise}

Design a finite automaton that accepts positive rational numbers written in decimal form. ($\Sigma$ contains the decimal point and digits $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$.) The number to be accepted is either an integer without decimal point (e.g. $123$), or it contains a decimal point. In this latter case numbers without integer part or fractional part must also be accepted, but at most one of these parts may be missing. (For example, $123.456$, $123.$ and $.456$ are all accepted, but a single decimal point is not.) It is also requested that a number cannot begin with dummy $0$'s, however $0.456$ is OK.)
