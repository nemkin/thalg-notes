\subsection {Session 11, Exercise 12}

\lineparagraph {Exercise}

Determine those binary trees whose vertices are listed by $PreOrder$ walk exactly in opposite order as it is
done by $PostOrder$ walk.

\lineparagraph {Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Since $PreOrder$ does $node, left(node), right(node)$ and $PostOrder$ does $left(node), right(node), node$, if there was an element in both the left and the right subtree, the order of those would not change relative to each other, so it could not result in a fully reversed order globally.
    \item So the only way we can get a completely reversed order is if every node has at most one child.
    \item That is called a linked list. For a linked list, these two walks indeed return exactly the opposite order ($node, child(node)$, vs $child(node), node$).
    \item So the linked list (the degenerative case of a binary seach tree) is the type of binary tree for which the result of $PostOrder$ and $PreOrder$ is exactly the opposite order.
\end{itemize}
