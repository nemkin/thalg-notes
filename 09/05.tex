\subsection {Session 9, Exercise 5}

\lineparagraph {Exercise}

Consider the problem that what is the maximum weight of a path in a edge weighted undirected graph.
Give the language that belongs to this problem and show that it is NP-complete.

\lineparagraph {Solution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item It is NP-complete.
    \item Use Witness Theorem to prove that this is in NP.
    \item Then, we will Karp-reduce the HAMPATH problem. We assign weights of $1$ to all edges in the graph, then we will try to find a path of weight $n-1$. This is only possible if that is a Hamiltonian-path.
    \item We can do this transformation in polynomial time.
\end{itemize}
