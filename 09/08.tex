\subsection {Session 9, Exercise 8}

\lineparagraph {Exercise}

A big firm moves to a new headquarters into a building of $F$ floors. Each floor has the same amount of office
space. Each department has a given office space requirement. We want to determine whether the move can
be done so that no department is cut, that is each department must have all its offices on the same floor
(however, more than one departments can have offices on the same floor). What is the language that belongs
to this problem? Is it in P or is it NP-complete?
